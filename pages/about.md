# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
I'm a new-to-practice Data Scientist/Engineer/Visualizer. I'm interested in the manipulation and wrangling of data to make it accessible to both other programmers, data scientists and lay-people. My hope is to use data to inform _good_ decisions with positive outcomes for folks who are typically excluded from the process.

Through time as a teacher leader I am experienced in professional facilitation, presentation and mentorship specifically around concerns of equity in outcomes and representation. Through years in the classroom I have honed my relationship-building, organizational, and critical thinking skills to partner with teachers, parents and students to ensure high, equitable outcomes for students. I am excited to bring this same approach to a new field by building consensus amongst stakeholders, analyzing problems and finding solutions.
