# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
I'm a new-to-practice Data Scientist/Engineer/Visualizer. I'm interested in the manipulation and wrangling of data to make it accessible to both other programmers, data scientists and lay-people. My hope is to use data to inform _good_ decisions with positive outcomes for folks who are typically excluded from the process.
