As a recent enrollee in the General Assembly Data Science Immersive program, one of the most common questions I get is

<blockquote>“What is Data Science, anyways?”</blockquote>

Fair question, perhaps. The technical definition reads something like “the creation of technological means by which to use data and knowledge to inform decision-making." There is also the oft-referenced Venn Diagram <a href="http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram" data-href="http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">created by Drew Conway</a>:

Or at least the point from which folks launch their expansion or critiques.

<blockquote>***But what does it mean?***</blockquote>

Great question. There’s a lot to unpack — much of which has come before but as a former teacher (of both very small children and the parents of those small children) one thing I have learned is that repeating your answer when asked to re-explain it leads to little understanding at best. There are a few paths to travel here, one of which I will explore today.

## Connecting to Everyday, Lived Experiences

Most folks these days commute. Whether it’s driving in a car, riding a bike, taking a bus or train, or walking — most folks need to leave the house in order to go to work, drop the kids at school, etc. In doing so we use a form of intuitive “Data Science” in the decisions we make. Let’s go through the three domains.
- ***Substantive Experience*** Each of us has our own body of experience in commuting. Whether it’s the speed at which you travel down the street to hit all your lights, the way buses respond to weather or the street with the best bike lane we come to the question of commuting with our own body of knowledge
- ***Math &amp; Statistics Knowledge*** Wait! Come back! Great, still here. This is an area that we also have our own body of knowledge in. Whether it is the odds that a bus comes on time or is late, the relative amount that traffic increases by leaving later or earlier or the odds of being able to get your bike onto the train, we all carry some insightful Math &amp; Statistics Knowledge with us into this situation
- ***Hacking Skills*** This is where it comes together in my mind. When you look at your mapping app are you automatically thinking of how your shortcut cuts down the time by 10 minutes? Or about how you know that if the commute is an hour now it will be an hour and a half in 10 minutes? Or have you figured out that a half hour commute on Monday takes 45 minutes while a half hour commute on Friday takes 25 minutes? These types of “hacks” in our thinking stitch it all together. 

## So how is this “Data Science” again?

The type of calculations that go into choosing when to leave and how to get someplace take into account our experiences, knowledge and skills in order to get us to work in the most efficient manner possible. For example, my commute involves:
1. Driving my daughter to school 2 miles away (5 minutes)
2. Driving back to my house (5 minutes)
3. Riding my bike 2.5 miles to the train station (12 minutes)
4. Taking the train (20 minutes)
5. Walking to General Assembly (5 minutes)
All told it takes between 40 and 50 minutes assuming typical experiences.

You might ask:
* Why not just put my daughter on the bike and ride to her school and then to the train?
* Why not just ride my bike all the way to General Assembly?
* Why not just drive all the way to the train station?
* Why not just drive all the way to General Assembly?

I would answer using a mix of these three areas (Experience, Knowledge and Skills)
* Sadly in my experience with the route between our house and the daycare my daughter is in, there are many streets that are safe for me alone on the bike, but not for the two of us together. Things are changing and she is growing so this could be revisited.
* Riding all the way to GA is not an option due to a lack of bike lanes on the Bay Bridge.
* Driving to the train station is an option. However there are two obstacles: traffic in the morning between our house and the train station is worse for cars than it is for bikes. I can get there in half the time on my bike. Additionally I have free bike valet parking at the train station. Parking for the car would be an additional expense.
* Driving all the way to GA is an option but would require me to join the mass of folks waiting in <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/08/22/bay-area-traffic-delays-rank-second-longest-in-nation/" data-href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/08/22/bay-area-traffic-delays-rank-second-longest-in-nation/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the second worst traffic in the nation</a>. Overall the time quoted by various mapping apps would be 50% longer given ideal circumstances.

This is excluding a general preference for public transit and cycling that I have, of course.

## Each of us, Every Day…
…are doing Data Science. In fact, I would hazard to say that ‘Data Science’ is a way to say “a method of making decisions based on experience, understanding and critical thinking.” It’s just that for some items you need a computer, a programming language and time in front of a keyboard in order leverage your experience to gain the understanding that informs your critical thinking in getting to an answer.
